This directory contains few examples of pseudo-potential generation.
The outputs are in the directory reference.

al.in      Generates a NC pseudo-potential pseudotype=1 
as.in      Generates a NC relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=2
o.in       Generates a US pseudo-potential RRKJ3 pseudotype=3 
pt.in      Generates a US relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=3

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples and compares the
outputs and the pseudo-potentials with those contained in reference.
The differences between these files is written into the file difference.
