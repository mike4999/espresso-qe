This directory contains few examples of PAW dataset generation (experimental).
The outputs are in the directory reference.

O_LDA.gen.in         generate a PAW dataset for O in LDA
O_LDA.test.in        test it in nonmagnetic configurations
O_LDA.spin.in        test it in magnetic configurations

O_PBE_NLCC.gen.in    the same as above, but with GGA and NLCC
O_PBE_NLCC.test.in
O_PBE_NLCC.spin.in

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples and compares the
outputs and the pseudo-potentials with those contained in reference.
A snapshot of the differences between these files is written to
standard output.
