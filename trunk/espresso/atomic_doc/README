This is the distribution of the ld1 code for electronic structure 
atomic calculations and pseudo-potentials generation.

- the LD1 package, mantained by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste) 
  is the result of several additions to the original 
  P. Giannozzi ld1 code for pseudopotentials generation. 
  (See http://www.sns.it/~giannozz/software.html) 

- Two new features are implemented:
  a) Generation and test of norm-conserving and ultrasoft 
     pseudo-potentials with the RRKJ3 recipe.
  b) Generation of spin-orbit splitted pseudo-potentials.

- Some features, present in the pseudo-potential code of P. Giannozzi, are
  not available in this package. The most relevant missing feature
  is the possibility to generate pseudo-potentials with the 
  TM recipe. (This will hopefully change in the next releases of the ld1 code).

Input variables are described in file INPUT_LD1.
Directories all-electron/, pseudo-gen/, pseudo-test/, 
contain tests for the three modes of operation, respectively:
all-electron run, pseudo-potential generation, pseudo-potential testing.
