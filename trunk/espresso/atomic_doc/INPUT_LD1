             method with 3 Bessel functions fails, specifying rho0 /= 0

Here are some recipes to reproduce old all-electron atomic results
with the ld1 program.

The Herman-Skillman tables can be reproduced with:
   rel=0,
   isic=0,
   latt=1,
   dft='SL1-NOC'

Data on the paper Liberman, Waber, Cromer Phys. Rev. 137, A27 (1965) can be 
reproduced with:

   rel=2,
   isic=0,
   latt=1,
   dft='SL1-NOC'

Data on the paper S. Cohen Phys. Rev. 118, 489 (1960) can be reproduced with:

   rel=2,

The revised PBE described in PRL 80, 890 (1998) can be obtained with:
