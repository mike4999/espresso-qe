c  The input for Raman consists of two pieces:
c     - a standard phonon input
c          IMPORTANT: the variable drho must be set
c                     as in the electric-field calculation
c          I recommend to use the same input card as in
c          the electric-field calculation
c
c     - the raman input

c

c             For metals only, requires gaussian smearing.
c             If elph.and.trans, the lambdas are calculated in the same

c             If elph.and..not.trans, the lambdas are calculated using
c             previously saved DeltaVscf in fildvscf, previously saved
c             dynamical matrix, and the present punch file. This allows
c             the use of a different (larger) k-point grid.
c
c zue         if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the 
c             effective charges are computed from the phonon
c             density responses. Note that if trans.and.epsil
c             effective charges are calculated using a different
c             algorithm. The results should be the same within
c             numerical noise.
