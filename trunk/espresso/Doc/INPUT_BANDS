  !      Program: bands.x
  !      Purpose: Rewrite the bands ordering them according to maximum overlap 
  !               of the wave-functions on neighbor k points
  !               and calculate properties of each eigen-function.
  !      Presently it can calculate:
  !      a) The expectation value of the spin operator on each spinor
  !         wave-function.
  !
  !      The input data of this program are read from standard input
  !      or from a file and have the following format:
  !
  ! Namelist &inputpp
  !      containing the variables :
  !
  ! prefix      prefix of files saved by program pw.x
  !
  ! outdir      temporary directory where pw.x files resides
  !
  ! filband     file "filband" contains the bands
  !
  ! spin_component in the lsda case select up (1) or down (2) spins
  !
  ! lsigma(i)  i=1,2,3. if true writes a file filband.i with the expectation
  !            values of the spin operator on the spinor wave-functions.
  !            (only in the noncollinear case).
  ! 
  ! lsym       if .true. the bands are classified according to the irreducible
  !            representations of the small group of k. A file "filband".rap
  !            with the same format of "filband" is written.
