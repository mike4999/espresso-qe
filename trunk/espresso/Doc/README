The following files are present in the released version 
The first two are obtained by typing "make log" in the root directory
The second two are obtained using pdflatex

The following files are present in the released version (obtained 
from the "helpdoc" utility: go into the ../doc-def/ directory, type
"make all". Note that "tcl", "tcllib", "xsltproc" are needed)
