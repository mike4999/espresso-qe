28 Sep 2004  release.sh script updated: Raman/ added (PG)
             SUN compilation problem in mp.f90 (PG)
             More cleanup of parallel variables and pwcom/phcom references.
             (C.S.)

27 Sep 2004  Documentation updated (PG)

27 Sep 2004  XLF workarounds no longer needed (the bug in the compiler has
             been fixed).
             Added a serial fft driver for FFTW needed by parallel PWCOND.
             (C.S.)

27 Sep 2004 Atoms are refolded using PBC in "cubefile" format.
            Several minor problems emerged with multiple compilations: 
            - CPV/compute_scf.f90 / FPMD/compute_scf.f90:
              tcpu was used but not initialized in compute_scf().
            - CPV/wf.f90:
              need to include 'f_defs.h' to get MPI_REAL8
            - Modules/wave_base.f90:
              include "f_defs.h" instead of "../include/f_defs.h" to be
              consistent with other files (and allow out-of-place compilation).
            - flib/transto.f90:
              include "opt_param.h" instead of "../include/opt_param.h" to be
              consistent with other files (and allow out-of-place compilation).
            - include/c_defs.h:
              set correct underscoring for alpha machines running linux 
              (discriminated from regular alpha by __LINUX64).
            - configure.ac:
              fix f90 compilation rule for platforms that need explicit
              preprocessing and make it compatible to builds using VPATH.
               support for alpha-linux with compaq compiler 
            (Axel Kohlmeyer)

27 Sep 2004 Bug in Modules/cell_base.f90 (dt2 not defined) fixed
            Bug in CPV/wf.f90 (iss2 not defined) temporarily fixed
            shmem_include only used if __SHMEM macro is defined
            More mergings between CPV and FPMD (init, grids setup)
            (CC)

27 Sep 2004 References to para module replaced (everywhere in PW ) by 
            references to mp_global, pfft, pffts.
            Old parallel variables me and mypool have been replaced by
            me_pool ( = ( me - 1 ) ) and my_pool_id ( = ( mypool - 1) ), 
            defined in mp_global.
            The old combination ( me == 1 .AND. mypool == 1 ) used in the I/O
            should be replaced by the logical variable ionode.
            All parallel variables (communicators included) are properly defined
            in the serial case too, so that "#ifdef __PARA" is not needed.
            (C.S.)
            Fourier String Method Dynamics improved: the number of fourier
            modes used to represent the path are gradually included (starting 
            from one up to num_of_images-2), so that the overall number of scf
            loops needed to reach convergence is considerably reduced (of a
            factor of 2-3). (C.S.)
            matdyn.f90, q2r.f90 modified to work in a parallel environment
            (only the first cpu does the job). (C.S.)
            Cleanup in phonon: variable max_time replaced by max_seconds.
            Doc updated (C.S.)

24 Sep 2004 atomic_number : patch from Axel, fixes the case of 
            atomic symbols with one letter

23 Sep 2004 "make tar" was not saving atomic_doc
            Misc. Alpha compilation errors and warning (PG)

22 Sep 2004 chdens: changes in the calculation of the makov-payne 
            correction. Now the MP term and the dipole are
            calculated using the same box and the same logic (PC)
            added case ifc7 on linux64 [Gerardo]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 20 Sep 2004    Version: pw-2-1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

20 Sep 2004 Major improvement of PWgui (TK)
            chdens can produce "cubefile" format (Gaussian)
            (contributed by Axel Kohlmeyer)

15 Sep 2004 All examples updated (CC)
            added mpf90, mpcc for Mac, support for ifort 8.1,
            ARCH variable to configure [Gerardo]
            Setup: inequivalent k-points not generated in berry or
            band-structure calculations.(C.S.)
            Path optimizations: added the possibility to write the 
            prefix.save file (logical varible write_save) relative
            to each image (needed for post-processing). (C.S.)
            Berry phase in parallel is implemented only along z.

14 Sep 2004 Allocation of evc when starting from atomic wavefunctions 
            modified so that evc contain only the real number bands and 
            not all the atomic wfcs (they can be much more than the
            number of bands). 
            unified setup.f90 for both collinear and noncollinear case.
            (CS)
            Pseudo-random wave functions initialization,
            independent from number of procs and architecture (CC) 
            Fixes for intel compiler 7.1:
            - pstickset arguments;
            - dummy argument to an external subroutine with implicit 
              dimensions ( i.e. a(:,:) ..... CALL sub( a, ... )
              replaced with a(:,:) ..... CALL sub( a(1,1), .... ) ) (CC)
            Raman with finite differences disabled (doesn't work any longer)
            Misc minor fixes (PG)

13 Sep 2004 Merge of cell dynamics (CC): 
            - same cell dynamics subroutines used in CP and FPMD
            - input pressure in GPa ( both code )
            - Output stress in GPa ( both code )
            - Output layout made more similar:
              energies, positions, forces, cell displayed in the same way
            - Zero velocities after a restart implemented in CP
            - Nose and damped dynamics for cell implemented
              in FPMD like in CP
            - CP main subroutine simplified
            Various GUI changes (TK)
            Minor output format change, examples updated (PG)
            DIIS: small bug-fix and general clean-up of the code.
            ionode substituted by meta_ionode (this because in neb and 
            smd all images have an ionode, but only one image, the one
            identified by meta_ionode, can check stop). (CS)

 8 Sep 2004 configure.old, documentation for configure updated [Gerardo]
            moved install/README.install to README.install_old [Gerardo]

            Examples 12, 13, 22 updated (SF)
            Bug fix: The dipole correction was not working with a 
            non-tetragonal cell. (Contributed by N. Bonini).

 1 Sep 2004 The error message is no longer written on /dev/stderr 
            (on linux clusters), but only on unit *. (C.S.)
            missing ZSYRK and ZSYR2K subroutines added to the 
            local copy of blas (PC)

             Z* are  written on output in a consistent way (Gernot)
             More merging between CP and FPMD:
             - initialization (both code uses the same ggen)
             - now FPMD initializes the small-boxes too (required for USPP)
             - print out
             (CC)

26 Aug 2004  Example 16 updated, misc cleanup, dynmat updated (PG)
             Changes to use of "fildrho" in phonon, d3, Raman calculationi
             calculation of nonlinear susceptibility fixed, example 15
             updated (Gernot)

25 Aug 2004  Fixed some errors in constrained dynamics. "Fixed atoms" and
             explicit constraints are now compatible when they do not involve
             the same atoms. Fixed a bug in the definition of the tangent
             in the Fourier string method dynamics. (CS)
             Makefiles, examples 8-11 updated. Old Raman code renamed 
             "phcg.f90" in order to avoid confusion with new code (PG)

             parallelization on images was not properly working
             cleanup in the way ATOMIC_POSITIONS card is readi.
             Minor fixes to compute_scf.f90 (C.S.)
             Minor Mac OS-X fix .

20 Aug 2004  Manuals for PW and CP/FPMD merged  [Gerardo]
             bugfix for configure on AIX [Gerardo]
             Added calculation of the Chemical shift tensor (NMR)

             unused case calculation='dispersion' removed (PG)
             Various missing README added, minor manual changes [Gerardo]

18 Aug 2004  NEB code reorganization. All the routines involved in "path" 
             optimization are grouped into modules starting with "path_". 
             The output has been slightly restyled. 
             In the pwscf code (only) has been implemented a version of the 
             string method (calculation='smd') in which the path is represented 
             in Fourier components and the optimization procedure is done on 
             these components (still to be optimized, but working).
             BFGS: Interpolation of the "accepted" bfgs step disabled 
             (not yet safe). (CS)

17 Aug 2004  Initialization of startingpot in the "raman" case fixed 
             Documentation update (PG)

16 Aug 2004  The fix for the problem "PBE on hydrogen atom" (see commit 
             10-05-2004) has been moved from gradcorr.f90 to 
             lsda_functionals.f90 so that both pwscf and the atomic code
             share the same fix (CS)

13 Aug 2004  Documentation for Raman updated (PG)

11 Aug 2004  Manual update and cleanup (GB, PG). 
             Added RANLIB=echo to old Make.* (PG)

 9 Aug 2004  Support for mac-osx added (contributed by Pascal Thibaudeau)
             Extensive documentation update and reshuffling : pwdocs
             and cpdocs merged into Doc (PG)

 9-Aug-2004  NEB restart file modified again: with the current implementation 
             of quick-min pos_old and grad_old need not to be saved in the
             restart file. Logical variables for reset_vel and frozen images
             have been moved from "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" to 
             "QUICK-MIN FIELDS". Old restart files can be easily converted
             removing in the "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" field all 
             logical variables and removing all the "QUICK-MIN FIELDS".
             (CS)

 1 Aug 2004  same variable accessed from 2 different modules, some
             compilers complain, fixed (CC)
