fildrho     file where the charge density responses are written     ' '

fildvscf    file where the the potential variation is written       ' '
            (for later use in electron-phonon calculation)

epsil       if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the      .false.
            macroscopic dielectric constant of the system is 
            computed. Do not set epsil to .true. if you have a
            metallic system or q/=0: the code will complain and stop

lrpa        if .true. the dielectric constant is calculated at the  .false.
            RPA level with DV_xc=0.

lnoloc      if .true. the dielectric constant is calculated without .false.
            local fields, i.e. by setting DV_H=0 and DV_xc=0. 

trans       if .true. the phonons are computed                      .true.
            If trans.and.epsil effective charges are calculated            

lraman      if .true. calculate nonresonant Raman coefficients      .false.
            using second-order response as in:
            M. Lazzeri and F. Mauri, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 036401 (2003)
            Optional variables for Raman:
    eth_rps threshold for calculation of  Pc R |psi>                1.0d-9
    eth_ns  threshold for non-scf wavefunction calculation          1.0e-12
    dek     delta_xk used for wavefunction derivation wrt k         1.0e-3

recover     if .true. restart from an interrupted run               .false.

elph        if .true. electron-phonon lambda coeffs are computed    .false.
            For metals only, requires gaussian smearing.
            If elph.and.trans, the lambdas are calculated in the same
            run, using the same k-point grid for phonons and lambdas
            If elph.and..not.trans, the lambdas are calculated using
            previously saved DeltaVscf in fildvscf, previously saved
            dynamical matrix, and the present punch file. This allows
            the use of a different (larger) k-point grid.

zue         if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the 
            effective charges are computed from the phonon
            density responses. Note that if trans.and.epsil
            effective charges are calculated using a different
            algorithm. The results should be the same within
            numerical noise.

fpol        if .true. calculate dynamic polarizabilities            .false.
            ( experimantal stage, see example33 for calculation
              of methane )

lnscf       If .TRUE. the run makes first a nscf calculation        .false.

ldisp       If .TRUE. the run calculates phonons for a grid of      .false.
            q-points specified by nq1, nq2, nq3  - for direct
            calculation of the entire phonon dispersion.
            The pw.x data file should not be produced using 
            "calculation='phonon'" in this case

nq1,nq2,nq3 parameters of the Monkhorst-Pack grid (no offset) used   0,0,0
            when ldisp=.true. Same meaning as for nk1, nk2, nk3
            in the input of pw.x

iq1,iq2,iq3 these go together with nq1, nq2, nq3 and allow to choose
            just one point out of the Monkhorst-Pack grid with ldisp=.true. 
            Note the the actual point chosen is something like
            (iq1-1)/nq1, (iq2-1)/nq2, (iq3-1)/nq3 (so, check the 
            output for what you get). Also make sure that PW left *.wfc
            files behind (no 'phonon' is needed though).

nrapp       choose the subset of irreducible representations (irreps)
            for which the linear response calculation is performed:
            "nrapp" irreps, specified in input (see below) are used.
            Default: nrapp=0, i.e. use all irreps . nrapp must be <= 3*nat
            Do not specify "nat_todo" together with "nrapp"

maxirr      perform calculations only up to the first "maxirr" irreps.
            Default: maxirr=0, i.e.  use all irreps. maxirr must be <= 3*nat
            Do not specify "nat_todo" or "nrapp" together with "maxirr"

nat_todo    choose the subset of atoms to be used in the linear response 
            calculation: "nat_todo" atoms, specified in input (see below)
            are displaced. Default: nat_todo=0, i.e. displace all atoms
            Do not specify "nrapp" together with "nat_todo"

                   End of namelist "inputph"

card 2   xq(3)   the phonon wavevector; must be equal to the one used
                 in the non-selfconsistent calculation (not read if 
                 ldisp is true).

card 3   list(na), na = 1, nrapp
                 contains the list of indices of irreps used in the
                 calculation if  "nrapp" is specified
OR:
card 3   atomo(na), na = 1, nat_todo
                 contains the list of indices of atoms used in the
                 calculation if  "nat_todo" is specified
