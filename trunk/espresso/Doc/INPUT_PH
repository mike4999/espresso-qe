c   phonon input cards are as follows:

c
cc  variable             meaning                              default value
c
c*********     Variables that MUST BE SPECIFIED      ********** 
c
c amass(ntyp) atomic mass of each atomic type

c
c outdir      scratch directory                                     './'
c
c prefix      prepended to input/output filenames                'pwscf'
c             must be the same used in the calculation
c             of unperturbed system
c
c niter_ph    maximum number of iterations in a scf step             50
c
c tr2_ph      threshold for selfconsistency                        1e-10
c
c alpha_mix(niter) mixing factor (for each iteration) for   alpha_mix(1)=0.7
c             updating the scf potential:
c             vnew(in) = alpha_mix*vold(out) + (1-alpha_mix)*vold(in)
c nmix_ph     number of iterations used in potential mixing          4
c
c iverbosity  iverbosity=0 short output, iverbosity=1 verbose output 0
c
c time_max    maximum allowed run time before the job stops smoothly
c
c fildyn      file where the dynamical matrix is written           'matdyn'
c
c fildrho     file where the charge density variations is written     ' '
c
c filelph     file where electron-phonon matrix elements are written  ' '
c
c fildvscf    file where the the potential variation is written       ' '
c             (for later use in electron-phonon calculation)
c
c maxirr      maximum number of irreducible representation to be      0 i.e. all
c             computed in a single run 
c
c epsil       if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the      .false.
c             macroscopic dielectric constant of the system is 
c             computed. 
c
c trans       if .true. the phonons are computed                      .true.
c             If trans.and.epsil effective charges are calculated            
c
c elph        if .true. electron-phonon lambda coeffs are computed    .false.
c             For metals only, requires gaussian smearing.
c             If elph.and.trans, the lambdas are calculated in the same
c             run, using the same k-point grid for phonons and lambdas
c             If elph.and..not.trans, the lambdas are calculated using
c             previously saved DeltaVscf in fildvscf, previously saved
c             dynamical matrix, and the present punch file. This allows
c             the use of a different (larger) k-point grid.
c
c zue         if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the 
c             effective charges are computed from the phonon
c             density responses. Note that if trans.and.epsil
c             effective charges are calculated using a different
c             algorithm. The results should be the same within
c             numerical noise.

c card 2   xq(3)   the phonon wavevector; must be equal to the one used
c                  in the non-selfconsistent calculation.
