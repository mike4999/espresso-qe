The Quantum-ESPRESSO package (opEn-Source Package for Research in 
Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) is the result 
of the merge of several pre-existing packages for electronic-structure
calculations:
- the PWscf package
- the CP code
and of several utilities, in particular:
- the PWgui graphical user interface for generating input data files
- the "atomic" pseudopotential generation code
- the Input/Output Toolkit "iotk"

In the following, the cited affiliation is the one where the last known 
contribution was done and may no longer be valid.

The maintenance and further development of the Quantum-ESPRESSO code
is promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center of the 
Italian INFM (http://www.democritos.it/), under the coordination of 
Paolo Giannozzi (Univ.Udine, Italy), with the strong support of the 
CINECA National Supercomputing Center in Bologna (http://www.cineca.it/),
under the responsibility of Carlo Cavazzoni (CINECA). 

The PWscf package (http://www.pwscf.org) was developed by Stefano Baroni, 
Stefano de Gironcoli, Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Giannozzi, 
and many others. We quote in particular:
- Matteo Cococcioni (MIT) for DFT+U implementation
- Oswaldo Dieguez (Rutgers) for Berry's phase calculations.
- Michele Lazzeri (Paris VI) for the 2n+1 code and Raman cross section
  calculation with 2nd-order response.
- Ralph Gebauer (ICTP Trieste) and Adriano Mosca Conte (SISSA) 
  for noncolinear magnetism
- Carlo Sbraccia (Princeton) for NEB, Strings method, Metadynamics, 
  for the improvements to structural optimization and to many other
  parts of the codes.
- Alexander Smogunov (SISSA) for ballistic conductance.
- Paolo Umari (Democritos) for finite electric fields.
- Renata Wentzcovitch (Univ.Minnesota) for variable-cell molecular dynamics.
- Davide Ceresoli (SISSA), Ari Seitsonen, U. Gerstmann, Francesco Mauri
  (Univ.Paris VI) for GIPAW (NMR chemical shifts and EPR g-tensor)
- Lorenzo Paulatto (SISSA) for PAW implementation, built upon previous
  work by Guido Fratesi (Univ.Milano Bicocca) and Riccardo Mazzarello (SISSA)

The CP code is based on the original code written by Roberto Car and 
Michele Parrinello. CP was developed by Alfredo Pasquarello
(IRRMA Lausanne), Kari Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave, Roberto Car 
(Princeton), Nicola Marzari (MIT), Paolo Giannozzi, and others.
FPMD, later merged with PC, was developed by Carlo Cavazzoni, 
Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA), Sandro Scandolo (ICTP), 
Guido Chiarotti (SISSA), Paolo Focher, and others.
We quote in particular:
- Carlo Sbraccia for NEB and Metadynamics.
- Manu Sharma (Princeton) and Yudong Wu (Princeton) for maximally
  localized Wannier functions and dynamics with Wannier functions.
- Paolo Umari for finite electric fields and conjugate gradients.
- Paolo Umari and Ismaila Dabo (MIT) for ensemble-DFT.
- Xiaofei Wang (Princeton) for META-GGA.
- Patrick Sit (MIT) for DFT+U implementation.
- The Autopilot feature was contributed by Targacept, Inc.

Other relevant contributions:
- Gerardo Ballabio wrote "configure" for Quantum-Espresso.
- PWgui was written by Anton Kokalj (IJS Ljubljana) and is based on his 
  GUIB concept (http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/).
- The pseudopotential generation package "atomic" was written by 
  Andrea Dal Corso and it is the result of many additions to 
  the original code by Paolo Giannozzi and others.
- The input/output toolkit "iotk" (http://www.s3.infm.it/iotk) used in
  Quantum-Espresso was written by Giovanni Bussi (ETHZ and S3 Modena).
- The calculation of the finite (imaginary) frequency molecular 
  polarizability using the approximated Thomas-Fermi  + von Weizaecker
  scheme was contributed by Huy-Viet Nguyen (SISSA),
- The calculation of RPA frequency-dependent complex dielectric function
  was contributed by Andrea Benassi (S3 Modena)
- The interface with the Wannier90 code (http://www.wannier.org/)
  was written by A. Mostofi, J. Yates, Y.-S Lee (MIT)
- The BlueGene porting was done by Costas Bekas and Alessandro Curioni
  (IBM Zurich).
- Davide Ceresoli, Andrea Ferretti (S3), Guido Fratesi, Jiayu Dai,
  Eyvaz Isaev (Moscow Steel and Alloy Inst), Axel Kohlmeyer (UPenn),
  Konstantin Kudin (Princeton), Sergey Lisenkov (Univ.Arkansas),
  Nicolas Mounet (MIT), Guido Roma (CEA), Pascal Thibaudeau (CEA), 
  answered questions on the mailing list, found bugs, 
  helped in porting to new architectures, wrote some code
