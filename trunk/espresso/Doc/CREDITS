The Quantum-ESPRESSO package (opEn-Source Package for Research in 
Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) is the result 
of the merge of several pre-existing packages for electronic-structure
calculations:
- the PWscf package
- the CP code
and of several utilities, in particular:
- the PWgui graphical user interface for generating input data files
- the "atomic" pseudopotential generation code.
- the Input/Output Toolkit "iotk"

The maintenance and further development of the Quantum-ESPRESSO code is
promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center of the Italian
INFM (http://www.democritos.it/), under the coordination of Paolo
Giannozzi (p.giannozzi@sns.it) (Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa), with
the strong support of the CINECA National Supercomputing Center in
Bologna (http://www.cineca.it/), under the responsibility of Carlo
Cavazzoni (c.cavazzoni@cineca.it).

Currently active developers include Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA), 
Stefano Fabris, Guido Fratesi, Adriano Mosca Conte (SISSA, Trieste), 
Anton Kokalj (Joszef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana), Carlo Sbraccia 
(Princeton).

The PWscf package was developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano
de Gironcoli, Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA), Paolo Giannozzi, and others.
The web site for PWSCF and related codes is: http://www.pwscf.org/

The CP code is based on the original code written by
Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello.


CP was developed by Alfredo Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne), Kari
Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave (LLNL), Roberto Car (Princeton),
Nicola Marzari (MIT), Paolo Giannozzi, and others.
Also developed by former FPMD team: Carlo Cavazzoni, Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA),
Sandro Scandolo (ICTP, Trieste), Guido Chiarotti (SISSA), Paolo
Focher, and others.

PWgui was written by Anton Kokalj (IJS) and is based on his GUIB
concept (http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/).

The pseudopotential generation package "atomic" was written by 
Andrea Dal Corso and it is the result of many additions to 
the original code by Paolo Giannozzi.

The input/output toolkit "iotk" was written by Giovanni Bussi
(S3 Modena).
