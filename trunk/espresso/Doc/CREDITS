The ESPRESSO package (opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic 
Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) is the result of the merge
of several pre-existing packages for electronic-structure
calculations:
- the PWscf package
- the FPMD code
- the CP code
and of several utilities, in particular:
- the PWgui graphical user interface for generating input data files
- a pseudopotential generation code.

The maintenance and further development of the ESPRESSO code is
promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center of the Italian
INFM (http://www.democritos.it/), under the coordination of Paolo
Giannozzi (p.giannozzi@sns.it) (Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa), with
the strong support of the CINECA National Supercomputing Center in
Bologna (http://www.cineca.it/), under the responsibility of Carlo
Cavazzoni (c.cavazzoni@cineca.it).

Currently active developers include Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA), 
Stefano Fabris, Adriano Mosca Conte, Carlo Sbraccia (SISSA,
Trieste), Anton Kokalj (Joszef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana).

The PWscf package was originally developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano
de Gironcoli, Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA), Paolo Giannozzi, and others.
The web site for PWSCF and related codes is: http://www.pwscf.org/

The FPMD and CP codes are both based on the original code written by
Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello.

FPMD was developed by Carlo Cavazzoni, Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA),
Sandro Scandolo (ICTP, Trieste), Guido Chiarotti (SISSA), Paolo
Focher, and others.

CP was developed by Alfredo Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne), Kari
Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave (UCBerkeley), Roberto Car (Princeton),
Nicola Marzari (MIT), Paolo Giannozzi, and others.

PWgui was written by Anton Kokalj (IJS) and is based on his GUIB
concept (http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/).

The pseudopotential generation package "atomic" was written by 
Andrea Dal Corso and it is the result of many additions to 
the original code by Paolo Giannozzi.
