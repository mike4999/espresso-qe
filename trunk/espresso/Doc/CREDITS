The ESPRESSO package (opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic 
Structure, Simulation, and Optimization) is the result of the merge
of several pre-existing packages for electronic-structure calculations:
- the PWscf package
- the FPMD code
- the CP code
and of several utilities, in particular:
- a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for generating input data files
- a pseudopotential generation code.

The maintenance and further development of the ESPRESSO code is promoted 
by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center (http://www.democritos.it) 
of the Italian INFM, under the coordination of Paolo Giannozzi, with the 
strong support of the CINECA National Supercomputing Center in Bologna, 
under the responsability of Carlo Cavazzoni. Currently active developers 
include Gerardo Ballabio (CINECA), Gernot Deinzer, Stefano Fabris, 
Adriano Mosca Conte, Carlo Sbraccia (SISSA), Anton Kokalj (IJS).

The PWscf package was originally developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano
de Gironcoli, Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Giannozzi
(Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa), and others.
The web site for PWSCF and related codes is http://www.pwscf.org

The CP code, based on the original code written by R. Car and M. Parrinello,
was developed by A. Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne), K. Laasonen (Oulu),
A. Trave (UCBerkeley), R. Car (Princeton), P. Giannozzi, N. Marzari (MIT),
and others.

The FPMD code, also based on the original code written by R. Car and 
M. Parrinello. was developed by C. Cavazzoni (CINECA, Bologna), S. Scandolo 
(ICTP, Trieste), G. Chiarotti (SISSA, Trieste), P. Focher, G. Ballabio, and 
others.

The GUI for PWscf was written by Anton Kokalj (IJS) and it is based on 
his GUIB concept: http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/.

The pseudopotential generation package "atomic" was written by 
Andrea Dal Corso and it is the result of many additions to 
the original code by Paolo Giannozzi.
