clib/      external libraries written in C
flib/      external libraries written in Fortran
install/   machine-dependent makefiles and tools for compilation
           and installation
pseudo/    pseudopotential files used by examples

CPV/       Source file for Car-Parrinello-Vanderbilt code
cpdoc/     documentation for CPV, ChangeLog, etc
cp_examples/

FPMD/      Source file for First-Principle Molecular Dynamics code
FPMD-doc/  documentation for FPMD, ChangeLog, etc

Installation:

In this directory, give command
./configure "target" 
(./configure with no argument yields a list of target:
 select those with cpv in the name for CPV, those with fpmd
 for FPMD, all the others are for PWscf)
Edit make.sys to adjust to your configuration. Then"
make "target", where "target" is one among the following:
      pw pp ph d3 gamma tools cpv fpmd
("make" with no arguments yield a list of targets)
Executables are created into the corresponding directory where
sources resides: that is, pw.x into PW/, ph.x into PH/, and so on.
If you want to have executables in bin/, use "make links" after
compilation (required to run the examples).
