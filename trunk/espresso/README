This is the distribution of the Quantum-ESPRESSO suite of codes (ESPRESSO: 
opEn-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, 
and Optimization), promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center 
of the Italian INFM (http://www.democritos.it). It contains the following 
codes for density-functional theory calculations of electronic structure,
based on plane waves and pseudopotentials:

- the PWscf package, developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano de Gironcoli, 
  Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Giannozzi (Scuola Normale,
  Pisa) and others: see http://www.pwscf.org for more information

- the CP code, developed by Alfredo Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne),
  Kari Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave (LLNL), Roberto Car
  (Princeton), Paolo Giannozzi, Nicola Marzari (MIT) and others,
  for Car-Parrinello variable-cell molecular dynamics 

- the FPMD code, developed by Carlo Cavazzoni (CINECA, Bologna),
  Sandro Scandolo (ICTP, Trieste), Guido Chiarotti (SISSA, Trieste), 
  Paolo Focher, Gerardo Ballabio and others, for Car-Parrinello 
  variable-cell molecular dynamics.

Several utilities are also included, in particular:

- a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for generating input data files,
  written by Anton Kokalj (IJS Ljubljana) (for more info, see 
  http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/pwgui , http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/)

- a pseudopotential generation code, written by Andrea Dal Corso

This distribution is a step in the ongoing work aiming at a full 
integration and interoperability of these codes. This project is 
part of a cooperative effort involving DEMOCRITOS, CINECA, Princeton 
University, University of Pennsylvania, New York University, IBM 
Corporation, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
