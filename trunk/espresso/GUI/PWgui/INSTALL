            * * * INSTALLATION instructions for PWgui * * *
 ==============================================================================

Because PWgui is written in [incr Tcl]---an extension of Tcl
scripting language----no compilation is needed.

*** HOWEVER *** the package depends on the [incr Tcl] and related
software. Therefore you have two possibility: 

   (i)  to use source package if required Tcl software is installed
        (see SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section below)
   (ii) to use self-contained "binary" package (which contains
        needed Tcl software)


VERY SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------

 1. untar the PWgui archive,
 2. define the PWGUI environmental variable,
 3. add $PWGUI to your path, and
 4. to launch the PWgui program, type: pwgui	


A BIT LONGER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------------------

To install the PWgui package do the following:

   1.) untar the *.tgz archive. use one of the following:

	gunzip -c pwgui.tgz | tar xvf -
     or
	gunzip pwgui.tgz; tar xvf pwgui.tar
     or 
        tar zxvf pwgui.tgz (for GNU tar program only)

   2.) define the PWGUI environmental variable to point to the package
       root directory

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PWGUI=/pwgui/root/dir; export PWGUI
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    setenv PWGUI /pwgui/root/dir

   3.) add the PWGUI environmental variable to your path. Depending
       on your shell edit one of ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.cshrc,
       or alike:

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PATH="$PWGUI:$PATH"
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    set path = ( $PWGUI $path )

   4.) to launch the PWgui program type: pwgui


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE
----------------------------------------

The PWgui source package depends on the following Tcl-related
software:

	Tcl+ Tk    >= 8.3
	Itcl+ Itk  >= 3.1
	Iwidgets   >= 3.0

The Itcl, Itk, and Iwidgets stand for: [incr Tcl], [incr Tk], and
[incr Widgets]. All these packages are usually already present on
modern Linux distributions, otherwise their RPMs (DEBs) can be easily
found on the WEB. 

See for example: http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/


Troubleshooting
***************

For some RedHat distributions the "itkwish" package used to be broken,
while for some Debian distributions the "pwgui" used to crash if it
was called with "wish" package. If you experience such kind of
troubles then replace the call to "wish" ("itkwish") with "itkwish"
("wish") in file pwgui.


SELF-CONTAINED "BINARY" PACKAGES
--------------------------------

For a few operating systems also self-contained "binary" packages are
available, which come with statically linked "itkwish" interpreter and
necessary Tcl + Tk + Itcl + Itk + Iwidgets library files. Use this
package if your computer does not have the necessary Tcl-related
software installed.

Current list of self-contained "binary" packages:

+ Linux-i386
