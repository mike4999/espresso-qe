 ==============================================================================

This is the PWgui---a GUI for the PWscf set of programs (see
http://www.pwscf.org/). PWgui is written in [incr Tcl]---an
extension of Tcl scripting language. Due to the use of scripting
language no compilation is needed for the PWgui. However the package
depends on the [incr Tcl] and related software. Therefore you have two
possibilities:

   (i)  to use source package if required Tcl software is installed
   (ii) to use self-contained "binary" package (which contains
        needed Tcl software)

See the file "INSTALL" for installation instructions.


CURRENT STATUS
--------------

This version of PWgui is compatible with PWscf v.2.0.

The aim of the PWgui GUI is to facilitate the creation and
manipulation (editing) of input files for PWscf set of programs. The
GUI can also use the XCRYSDEN program (http://www.xcrysden.org/) for
the visulazation of atomic structures from the pw.x input file.

Currently, the following PWscf programs (modules) are supported: 

 * pw.x
 * ph.x
 * pp.x
 * chdens.x
 * projwfc.x
 * d3.x
