This directory contains a few examples of simple GUIB definition
files. The test*.tcl are the definition files for GUIs, while
test*.inp are input files as saved by the GUIs. They can be opened
using the File->Open menu of the corresponding GUIs.

To construct a given GUI you need to define the GUIB environmental
variable to point to the GUIB root directory. Then execute:

$GUIB/guib xxxx.tcl

where xxxx.tcl stands for a given example of *.tcl definition file.
