***  Machine- , compiler- , library-dependent preprocessing options  ***

* include/fft_defs.h

contains the type for C pointers called by fortran:
   C_POINTER is integer*8 for 64-bit machines,
                integer*4 on most other machines
automatically generated by configure using include/fft_defs.h.in

* include/f_defs.h

contains definitions to be included in FORTRAN files ONLY

* include/c_defs.h

contains definitions to be included in C files ONLY

*  iotk/include/iotk_config.h

contains definitions for iotk

* preprocessing options used in *.h files and in the code
