Time Dependent Density Functional Perturbation Theory (TDDFPT)

To run all examples do "make normal_test" 

"make clean" resets the tests 

"make small_test" runs a short test, useful for checking compilation

each example can be run separately by running "make" in its designated directory

make.sys can be edited for parallel executions of tests by editing "RUNNER" variable (i.e. RUNNER=mpirun -np 4)

Examples: 
Benzene: Benzene molecule, Tests the real_space and tqr implementations
CH4: Tests Norm Conserving PP implementation
CH4-PR: Tests charge response algorithm
SiH4: Tests Ultrasoft PP implementation
CH4-BOND: This is an example that shows visual analysis of a softened bond in a set of degenerate bonds. 
tools: Tools to compare data.
