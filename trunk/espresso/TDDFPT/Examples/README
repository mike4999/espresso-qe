Time Dependent Density Functional Perturbation Theory (TDDFPT)

Run examples after compiling by running "make" 

"make clean" resets the tests 

"make small_test" runs a short test

each example can be run seperately by running "make" in its designated directory

make.sys can be edited for parallel executions of tests by editing "RUNNER" variable (i.e. RUNNER=mpirun -np 4)

Examples: 
Benzene: Benzene molecule, Tests the real_space and tqr implementations
CH4: Symmetry reduced calculation for CH4, tests Norm Conserving PP implementation
SiH4: Symmetry reduced calculation for SiH4, tests Ultrasoft PP implementation
tools: Tools to compare data.
