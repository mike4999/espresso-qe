RGB calculator, by Ge Xiaochuan, Version 5
Modified from version4 by XC.G  21.May.2012
New features: automatical sorting and interpolation algorithm is added 

There are two *.jar in the directory, one for version 4 and one for version 5.
By typing "java -jar ColorCalcolator5.jar" in the terminal the user interface
will be launched and you can choose example input files on the left of the 
interface, the corresponding color and RGB values will be displayed on the 
right.

There are three pelargonin*.dat files in this directory. They are examples 
of spectrum input files. They are essentially the same absorption spectrum 
with different grids setting. This is because the older version can't adapt 
different grids setting but the new one does. A fourth example, colorBlue.dat,
is also available.

For using your own input, just simply create a file ith the suffix .dat in 
which the first column is the wavelength(nm) and the second column is the
absorption strength. Keep the input file in the same directory then you can 
see it in the UI.
