!    total energy              =  -333.73911247 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =  -333.73911247 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <        7.8E-13 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =   -80.06099051 Ry
     hartree contribution      =    67.51226520 Ry
     xc contribution           =   -49.64774348 Ry
     ewald contribution        =  -271.54264368 Ry

     convergence has been achieved
