This example shows how to run a meta-dynamics simulation (at T=0) using both 
pw.x and cp.x to explore different conformations of the Si6H6 molecule.

BEWARE: this example is intended as a test to validate the working condition of
meta-dynamics and NOT to demonstrate the efficiency of of this algorithm for a
conformational search.

Given the low accuracy of these calculations (plane waves cut-off and 
thresholds), the small box employed, and the risible number of steps performed  
these results can not be compared with experiments or with other "ab initio" 
calculations.
