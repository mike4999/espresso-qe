This example shows how to run cp.x to do String method (SMD) to find
the minimum energy path (MEP).

To use this method, one must know the initial and the final state.
They should be obtained using regular CPMD optimization before running
the SMD.

The example first optimize the electronic degrees of freedom of the
string, and then start SMD optimization to find the MEP, sequentially.

Details can be found in JCP 121, 3359 (2004).

This example consists in 7 calculations and takes a long time.
In order to run calculations up to the N-th, use:
   ./run_example N
Note that "./run_example" alone does nothing.
