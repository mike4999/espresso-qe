# environment_variables -- settings for running PWscf examples

######## YOU MUST EDIT THIS FILE TO MATCH YOUR CONFIGURATION ########

# BIN_DIR = path of compiled PWscf executables
#     Usually this is $TOPDIR/bin, where $TOPDIR is the root of the
#     PWscf source tree.  (You must have run "make links".)
# PSEUDO_DIR = path of pseudopotentials required by the examples
#     If you have downloaded the full PWscf distribution, they should
#     be already in $TOPDIR/pseudo; otherwise you may download them
#     from www.pwscf.org/pseudo.
# TMP_DIR = temporary directory to be used by the examples
#     Make sure that it exists, is writable by you, and doesn't
#     contain any valuable data (everything there will be destroyed!).

BIN_DIR=$HOME/O-sesame/bin
PSEUDO_DIR=$HOME/O-sesame/pseudo
TMP_DIR=$HOME/tmp

# To run the PWscf programs on a parallel machine, you may have to add
# the appropriate commands (poe, mpirun, mpprun...) and/or options
# (specifying number of processors, pools...) before and after the
# executable's name.  That depends on how your machine is configured.
# For example on an IBM SP4:
#
#     poe             pw.x -procs 4              < file.in > file.out
#     ^^^ PARA_PREFIX      ^^^^^^^^ PARA_POSTFIX
#
# To run on a single processor, you can usually leave them empty.
