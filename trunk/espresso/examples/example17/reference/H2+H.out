     Today is 21Dec2007 at  3:51:42 

     Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials and PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
