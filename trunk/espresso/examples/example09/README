This example shows how to use the Gamma-only version of pw.x and ph.x
(respectively pw.x and phcg.x) to calculate the normal modes of SiH4

1) make a self-consistent calculation at Gamma.
   (input=sih4.scf.in, output=sih4.scf.out)

2) make a phonon calculation for the Gamma point.
   (input=sih4.nm.in, output=sih4.nm.in)

Note that the calculation is not intended to be a good one,
but just a test one! Rotation modes have negative frequencies.
This is a consequence of the supercell approach.
