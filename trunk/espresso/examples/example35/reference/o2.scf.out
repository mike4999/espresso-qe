!    total energy              =     -63.51532664 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -63.51532664 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.8E-14 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -86.04389045 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      45.32338225 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -13.60748803 Ry
     ewald contribution        =      -9.18733040 Ry

     total magnetization       =     2.00 Bohr mag/cell
     absolute magnetization    =     2.05 Bohr mag/cell

     convergence has been achieved in   7 iterations
