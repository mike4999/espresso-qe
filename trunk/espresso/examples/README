These are basic instructions on how to run the examples contained
within the "examples" directory of the PWscf distribution (same
directory where this README file should be).

1) Edit the file "environment_variables" in the "examples" directory
   and set the following variables as needed:

     BIN_DIR = path of compiled PWscf executables
     PSEUDO_DIR = path of pseudopotentials required by the examples
     TMP_DIR = temporary directory to be used by the examples

   If you have downloaded the full PWscf distribution, you may set
   BIN_DIR = $TOPDIR/bin and PSEUDO_DIR = $TOPDIR/pseudo, where
   $TOPDIR is the root of the PWscf source tree.  (Accordingly, the
   examples directory should be $TOPDIR/examples.)  To have the
   executables in $TOPDIR/bin, you must have run "make links" after
   compiling.

   TMP_DIR must be a temporary storage area you have read/write access
   to, is large enough to host the temporary files produced by the
   PWscf programs, and possibly offers high I/O performance (no NFS).

2) Check that the directory specified by PSEUDO_DIR contains the
   following files:    

     Al.vbc.UPF, As.gon.UPF, Cu.pz-d-rrkjus.UPF, CUS.RRKJ3.UPF,
     CuUS.RRKJ3.UPF, Fe.pz-nd-rrkjus.UPF, Ni.pbe-nd-rrkjus.UPF,
     NiUS.RRKJ3.UPF, O.LDA.US.RRKJ3i.UPF, Si.vbc.UPF, H.vbc.UPF,
     Pb.vdb.UPF, O.vdb.UPF, Ti.vdb.UPF

   If any of these are missing, you may not be able to run some of the
   examples.  You can download the missing ones from the web at the
   address: http://www.pwscf.org/pseudo.htm

3) ONLY FOR PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES: to run parallel jobs, your machine
   may require that executable programs be run through a driver
   program such as "poe" or "mpiexec".  For example on an IBM SP4,
   pw.x could be run on 4 processors this way:

     poe pw.x -procs 4 < file.in > file.out

   If this is the case, you must edit again the file
   "environment_variables" and set the PARA_PREFIX and PARA_POSTFIX
   variables as needed.  Parallel executables will be run by a command
   like this:

     $PARA_PREFIX pw.x $PARA_POSTFIX < file.in > file.out

   Thus, in the example above, you should set PARA_PREFIX="poe" and
   PARA_POSTFIX="-procs 4".

   Also, if the machine does not support interactive use, you should
   write the commands specified below in a batch script, and run it
   through the batch queuing system installed on that machine.

4) To run a specific example: cd to the corresponding directory (i.e.,
   example01) and execute:

     ./run_example

   A subdirectory "results" is produced which collects the input and
   output files generated by the calculation.  The results can be
   compared to those in the "reference" subdirectory coming with this
   distribution.

   The reference results where generated on a 1.7 GHz Pentium IV using
   Intel compiler (ifc) v.6 and MKL libraries v.5.1.
   On different architectures the precise numbers could be slightly
   different (in particular if different FFT dimensions are
   automatically selected) but not in any significant way.

5) To check the generated results against those in the "reference"
   directory coming with this distribution, execute:

     ./check_example example_dir

   from the "examples" directory.
   "example_dir" is the directory of the example that you want to
   check (i.e., ./check_example example01).  You can specify multiple
   directories.

   Note: at the moment "check_example" is in early development and
   known not to work in many cases, in particular you should only run
   it on examples 1 to 4.

6) To run all the examples in one go, execute:

     ./run_all_examples

   from the "examples" directory.

7) To restore the examples subdirectories to their original content,
   run the "make_clean" script.  For each example, this removes the
   subdirectory "results" together with all files apart from "README",
   and "run_example".  If additional subdirectories have been created
   they are not deleted.
