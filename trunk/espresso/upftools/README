Pseudopotentials in PWSCF and CASINO
====================================

THIS SECTION TO BE WRITTEN - AWAITING MODIFICATIONS OF THESE TOOLS BY SIMON 
BINNIE

Look in the upftools directory of the espresso distribution. Here you will 
find: 

casino2upf.f90
  
   A tool to convert a pseudopotential written in CASINO tabulated
   format to unified pseudopotential format.

   (This tool also exists in the utils/pseudo_converters/pwscf directory of
    the CASINO distribution, as does another utility by John Trail which
    appears to do the same thing..).
