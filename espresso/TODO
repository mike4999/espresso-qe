TODO LIST - 2 Jul 2004
(does not include new developments!)

INSTALLATION/PORTING

- expand new configure to cover as many configurations as possible

- too many options for SGI machines

COMMON

- fix shift in eigenvalues between CP/FPMD and PW
  The eigenvalues must be the same!!!

- fix shift in total energy between CP, FPMD and PW
  for charged systems. Total energies for charged systems
  must be the same!!!

- merge (standard) diagonalization routines
  use parallel diagonalization in CP and PW

- merge spherical harmonics between CP-PW and FPMD
  merge integration routines, random number generators
  spherical bessel: add routine directly calculating dj_l(x)/dx,
  verify limits x=>0, fix special cases x=>0 into the codes

- variable declarations : real(kind=DP), or real(dbl), everywhere

- real vs dreal, cmplx vs dcmplx, float vs dble, etc

- error is in flib/ but requires modules: not a good solution,
  things in flib/ should not use modules except maybe kinds   

- replace calls to level-1 blas copy, scal, axpy, with f90 syntax

- cleanup and merge of routines reading and processing PPs;
  merge uspp-related stuff ("small box") of CP into PW

PW

- cleanup of parallel stuff: removal of old-style variables

- remove iswitch, replace with existing (minus_q, lscf)
  or new logical variables

- maximize merge of colinear (PW) and with noncolinear (PWNC) code

- add traceback in error (error_handler module)

- remove potential mixing, save and start from rho instead of V,
  at least for scf calculations. Requires fixing the noncolinear
  and electric-field cases. For non-scf calculations: we may
  still start from V, but the output file MUST include the scf rho,
  not a bogus rho as it may happen now

- save rho and/or V in G-space instead of R-space
  check that what is read makes sense

- extend to CP/FPMD possibility to save wavefunctions either 
  'distributed' or 'collected' in parallel execution

- add possibility to read atomic positions from file

- Use more standard choices for crystal axis

- fix problem with j'_l(x)Y_lm(x) for x -> 0 and l=1

- make hpsi/spsi/newd/addusdens/CG/DIIS  faster
  - remove complex factor i**l from beta fct and q(r) (preliminary)
  - shift structure factor from beta to psi when computing becp (reduce memory)
  - use real BLAS routine instead of COMPLEX one in hpsi/spsi 
    (at least 2 times faster).
  - use only half of the G's when computing real integrals (2 times faster)
  - seek for CG and DIIS algoritms that only use (H-eS)|psi> and not
    the two vector separately ... compute it in one single call. (this way
    S|psi> is  inexpensive)

- output should be more informative and less confused
  the printout with UPF PP is incomplete or misleading (lloc=0)

- write explicitly and unambiguosly the units of output quantities

POSTPROCESSING

- complete postprocessing in Gamma case

- stm_wfc_matching not working

- the dynamical matrix written by the phonon code does not contain
  the information on lattice basis vectors if ibrav=0.
  As a consequence most postprocessing codes will not work 

- reconstruction of all-electron wavefunctions

PH, D3, Gamma

- better algorithm for electron-phonon (Malgorzata?)

- replace "use pwcom" into more "use" statements


DOCUMENTATION

- examples for some features are still missing
  automated testing procedure: how to deal with numerical differences?

- expand and update the manual; add a list of FAQ, or of already
  answered questions

- complete the developer's (technical) guide

FPMD:

- Documentation is nonexistent

CPV: 

- Documentation needs serious improvements

- check on small box size

- the output is horrible
