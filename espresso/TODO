TODO LIST - 19 May 2003

INSTALLATION

- compile fftw by default for PW and CP as well
  (a che serve FFTW_INC_DIR ?)

COMMON

- fix shift in eigenvalues between CP/FPMD and PW
  The eigenvalues must be the same!!!

- fix shift in total energy between CP, FPMD and PW
  for charged systems. Total energies for charged systems
  must be the same!!!

- merge diagonalization routines, use parallel diag everywhere

- start merge of input routines

- merge spherical harmonics, bessel, integration routines, etc

- variable declarations : real(kind=DP), or real(dbl), everywhere

- real vs dreal, cmplx vs dcmplx, dfloat etc

- update to fftw v.3 (if convenient)?

PW

- replace "use pwcom" into more "use" statement

- add traceback in error (error_handler module)

- bfgs, md : atomic positions should be written in the same
  format as they are read (but this should not spoil scripts
  that extract coordinates from output file)

- remove analytical PPs and related variables

- remove residual direct calls to MPI routines,
  use (or merge with) existing routines in mp.f90 instead

- remove potential mixing, save and start from rho instead of V

- remove all calls to setv and to blas copy, scal

- save rho and/or V in G-space instead of R-space
  check that what is read is sensible

- remove old punch, use new punch, add possibility to save
  wavefunctions either 'distributed' or 'collected' in
  parallel execution (requires identifier in the first line
  of the file) 

- add possibility to read atomic positions from file

- read a, b, c, cosab, cosbc, cosac instead of celldm
  Use more standard choices for crystal axis

- fix problem with j'_l(x)Y_lm(x) for x -> 0 and l=1

- complete and verify memory estimator

- ultrasoft PP: newd and addusdens are too slow

- output should be more informative and less confused

POSTPROCESSING

- bands.x must either be finished or removed

- postprocessing/pwtools in the parallel case
  and with new_punch must be verified

- stm in non-scf calculations to be verified

- add more scripts that process output files

- dos, projected dos, etc: input data should be more uniform

PH

- Tone: ntyp in input needed for phonon GUI ?

- better algorithm for electron-phonon (Malgorzata)

DOCUMENTATION

- examples for many features are missing
  examples should be quicker and easier to verify  

- expand and update the manual; add a list of FAQ, or of already
  answered questions

- add a developer's guide

FPMD:

- Documentation is nonexistent

CPV: 

- Documentation needs serious improvements

- check on input ipp and pp type. Even better: remove ipp
  (leave either UPF or old-format Vanderbilt)

- check on small box size

- remove all calls to zero and to blas copy, scal
