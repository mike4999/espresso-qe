This is the distribution of codes for electronic structure calculations
promoted by the DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center of the Italian
INFM (http://www.democritos.it). It includes all or part of the following:

- the PWscf package, developed by Stefano Baroni, Stefano de Gironcoli, 
  Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste), Paolo Giannozzi (Scuola Normale,
  Pisa) and others: see http://www.pwscf.org for more information

- the CP code, developed by Alfredo Pasquarello (IRRMA, Lausanne),
  Kari Laasonen (Oulu), Andrea Trave (UCBerkeley), Roberto Car
  (Princeton), Paolo Giannozzi, Nicola Marzari (MIT) and others,
  for Car-Parrinello variable-cell molecular dynamics 

- the FPMD code, developed by Carlo Cavazzoni (CINECA, Bologna),
  Sandro Scandolo (ICTP, Trieste), Guido Chiarotti (SISSA, Trieste), 
  Paolo Focher, Gerardo Ballabio and others, for Car-Parrinello 
  variable-cell molecular dynamics

This is a step in the ongoing work aiming at a full integration
and interoperability of these codes. This project is part of a
cooperative effort involving DEMOCRITOS, CINECA, Princeton University, 
University of Pennsylvania, New York University, IBM Corporation, 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Directory structure of the common part of the three packages:

install/   machine-dependent makefiles and tools for compilation
           and installation
pseudo/    pseudopotential files used by examples
upftools/  Source files for converters to unified pseudopotential
           format (UPF)
