This directory contains few examples of pseudo-potentials tests.
The outputs are in the directory reference.
Any pseudo-potential format readable by ld1 can be converted to the UPF
format by the ld1 program.

s.in       Test a NC pseudo-potential (old format)
ni.in      Test a US pseudo-potential pseudotype=3 (old format)
rh.in      Test a US pseudo-potentials with NLCC (UPF format)
al.in      Test a NC pseudo-potential pseudotype=1 (old format)
ga.in      Test a NC relativistic pseudo-potential pseudotype=1
as.in      Test a NC relativistic pseudo-potential (UPF format)

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples and compares the
outputs and the pseudo-potentials with those contained in reference.
The differences between these files is written into the difference file.

NB: The PWscf program can read UPF pseudo-potentials, non relativistic,
and scalar relativistic. Spin-orbit splitted pseudo-potentials are
supported by the non-collinear version of pw.x in the PWNC directory.
