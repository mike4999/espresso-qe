he.in: convergence problems apparently related to SIC, worse with LSD

This directory contains a few examples of all-electron inputs.
The output are in the directory "reference/". Input data:

h.in       Non-relativistic, sic correction,  sigma-GGA (PW91)
he.in      Non-relativistic, sic correction,  sigma-GGA (PBE)
f.in       Scalar relativistic, sic correction, LDA
mg.in      Dirac relativistic, latter correction, as in the HS tables [1]
fe.in      Dirac-relativistic, Hartree calculation, no exchange       [1]
cu1.in     Dirac relativistic, latter correction, as in the HS tables [1]
cu.in      Non-relativistic, Hartree calculation, no exchange         
ar.in      Non-relativistic, sic correction,  LDA                     [3]
pt.in      Dirac relativistic, latter correction, as in the HS tables [1]
u1.in      Dirac relativistic, latter correction, as in the HS tables [1]
u.in       Dirac relativistic, sic correction, PBE
w.in       Dirac relativistic, latter correction, as in the HS tables [1]
ne_oep.in  Non-relativistic, Optimized Effective Potential, no spin
c_oep.in   Non-relativistic, Optimized Effective Potential, spin-pol.

The script test.job runs ld1.x on these examples, writes the outputs
into directory "results/", compares them with reference outputs and
writes the differences between these files into file "difference".
