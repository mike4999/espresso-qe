This is the distribution of the ld1 code for electronic structure 
atomic calculations and pseudo-potentials generation.

- the LD1 package, mantained by Andrea Dal Corso (SISSA, Trieste) 
  is the result of several additions to the original 
  P. Giannozzi ld1 code for pseudopotentials generation
  (See http://www.sns.it/~giannozz/software.html).

- Two new features are implemented:
  a) Generation and test of norm-conserving and ultrasoft pseudo-potentials
     with the Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos (RRKJ) recipe
     ( Phys. Rev. B41, 1227 (1990); Phys. Rev. B 44, 13175 (1991) )
  b) Generation of fully relativistic pseudo-potentials including 
     spin-orbit coupling.

- Some features, present in the pseudo-potential code of P. Giannozzi, 
  are not available in this package. 

Input variables are described in file INPUT_LD1.
Directories all-electron/, pseudo-gen/, pseudo-test/, 
contain tests for the three modes of operation, respectively:
all-electron run, pseudo-potential generation, pseudo-potential testing.
