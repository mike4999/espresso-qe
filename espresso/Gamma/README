This directory contains a Gamma-only, q=0 version of the
phonon code, called phcg.x, using a conjugate-gradient
algorithm for the solution of linear-response equations.
Useful for normal mode calculations in molecules.
Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are not implemented.

The phcg.x code can also calculate nonresonant Raman 
coefficients as finite differences of the dielectric
tensor. This feature is quite experimental and not 
thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.
