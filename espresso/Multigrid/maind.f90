c* Licensing, permission to use, modify, and distribute
c* ====================================================
c*
c* The code has been placed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  
c*
c* This means that essentially you can use and modify the code as you like, 
c* under a few conditions, such as acknowledging the authors of the original 
c* code in any derived works, such as new programs or research results using 
c* the code.
c*
c* Please have a look at the GPL which should have accompanied the code.
c* If it is missing, please write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 
c* 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
c*
c* It would have been easier for me to just keep the code completely private, 
c* or to hand out very restricted use copies.  However, in the interests of 
c* freedom of information, the advancement of science, the future of the 
c* planet, and so on, I decided to distribute the code in this very free way.
c* The GNU world functions very much on the honor system.  I want you to have 
c* all of my source code because I think it will do more toward helping you 
c* understand the ideas in there than anything else.  The GNU idea is that in 
c* return for all of my work on the source code and the ideas behind it, all I 
c* ask for is some acknowledgment in your derived works for using my original 
c* code and the original ideas that went into the code.  For GNU to be viable, 
c* we all need to abide by this very minimal requirement.
c*
c* I'm typing this on a nearly all-GNU system right now, namely Linux 1.2.8, 
c* a GNU version of UN*X available under the same conditions as PMG.
c* I.e., you get all of the source code for the entire UN*X operating system.

c* -------
c*
c*    this program uses a numerical method to solve the following
c*    three-dimensional, 2nd order linear elliptic partial 
c*    differential equation:
c*
c*            lu = f, u in omega
c*             u = g, u on boundary of omega
c*
c*    where
c*
c*            omega = [xmin,xmax] x [ymin,ymax] x [zmin,zmax]
c*
c*    the multigrid code requires the operator in the form:
c*
c*           - \nabla \cdot (a \nabla u) + c u = f
c*
c*    with;
c*
c*        a=(a1(x,y,z),a2(x,y,z),a3(x,y,z)), c(x,y,z), f(x,y,z), 
c*        all scalar functions (possibly discontinuous) on omega.
c*        (the discontinuities must be along grid lines on fine grid.)
c*        the boundary function g(x,y,z) is smooth on boundary of omega.
c*
c* user inputs:
c* ------------
c*
c*    the user selects one of several possible methods:
c*       (1) multigrid
c*       (2) ...
c*
c*    the calls to each of the routines are as follows:
c*
c*       call mgdriv (iparm,rparm,iwork,rwork,u,
c*   .      xf,yf,zf,gxcf,gycf,gzcf,a1cf,a2cf,a3cf,ccf,fcf,tcf)
c*
c*    where the parameters are as follows:
c*
c*       iparm     = integer parameters for the solver
c*       rparm     = real parameters for the solver
c*       iwork     = some integer work space
c*       rwork     = some real work space
c*       u         = solution (perhaps some initial approximation)
c*       xf        = the x-coordinates of the tensor-product mesh
c*       yf        = the y-coordinates of the tensor-product mesh
c*       zf        = the z-coordinates of the tensor-product mesh
c*       gxcf      = the x=xmin and x=xmax boundary types and conditions
c*       gycf      = the y=ymin and y=ymax boundary types and conditions
c*       gzcf      = the z=zmin and z=zmax boundary types and conditions
c*       a1cf      = entry (1,1) of the diagonal tensor "a" above
c*       a2cf      = entry (2,2) of the diagonal tensor "a" above
c*       a3cf      = entry (3,3) of the diagonal tensor "a" above
c*       ccf       = the coefficient "c" above
c*       fcf       = the sourse function "f" above
c*       tcf       = the true solution of the pde if available (for testing)
c*                   (must always be provided as may be used for storage)
c*
c*    the sizes of the arrays must be as follows:
c*
c*       nxm    = number of x-points in the tensor-product mesh
c*       nym    = number of y-points in the tensor-product mesh
c*       nzm    = number of z-points in the tensor-product mesh
c*       nf     = nxm * nym * nzm (total number of nodes)
c*
c*       ifudge = 1000
c*       nfarr  = nf + nf/6 + ifudge
c*       niwk   = calculated by multigrid code based on input parameters
c*       nrwk   = calculated by multigrid code based on input parameters
c*
c*       iparm  = iparm(100)
c*       rparm  = rparm(100)
c*       iwork  = iwork(niwk)
c*       rwork  = rwork(nrwk)
c*       a1cf   = a1cf(nfarr)
c*       a2cf   = a2cf(nfarr)
c*       a3cf   = a3cf(nfarr)
c*       ccf    = ccf(nfarr)
c*       fcf    = fcf(nfarr)
c*       tcf    = tcf(nfarr)
c*       u      = u(nfarr)
c*       xf     = xf(nxm*5)
c*       yf     = yf(nym*5)
c*       zf     = zf(nzm*5)
c*       gxcf   = gxcf(nym*nzm*10)
c*       gycf   = gycf(nxm*nzm*10)
c*       gzcf   = gzcf(nxm*nym*10)
c*
c*   note that all of the above arrays are written over by the multigrid
c*   code during processing; there is no extra storage here.
c*
c*   the parameters that must be initialized in the iparm and rparm
c*   arrays in different ways for the three methods.  for example,
c*   the multigrid code requires the following:
c*
c*       *** integer parameters ***
c*       iparm(1)  = nrwk
c*       iparm(2)  = niwk
c*       iparm(3)  = nx
c*       iparm(4)  = ny
c*       iparm(5)  = nz
c*       iparm(6)  = nlev
c*       iparm(7)  = nu1
c*       iparm(8)  = nu2
c*       iparm(9)  = mgkey
c*       iparm(10) = itmax
c*       iparm(11) = istop
c*       iparm(12) = iinfo
c*       iparm(13) = irite
c*       iparm(14) = ipkey
c*       iparm(15) = ipcon
c*       iparm(16) = nonlin
c*       iparm(17) = mgprol
c*       iparm(18) = mgcoar
c*       iparm(19) = mgdisc
c*       iparm(20) = mgsmoo
c*       iparm(21) = mgsolv
c*       iparm(22) = iperf
c*
c*       *** real parameters ***
c*       rparm(1)  = errtol
c*       rparm(3)  = xmin
c*       rparm(4)  = xmax
c*       rparm(5)  = ymax
c*       rparm(6)  = ymax
c*       rparm(7)  = zmax
c*       rparm(8)  = zmax
c*       rparm(9)  = omegal
c*       rparm(10) = omegan
c*
c*    the following are returned from the multigrid solver:
c*
c*       u         = the computed solution
c*       iparm(50) = iters  (number of iters taken to reach tolerance)
c*       iparm(51) = ierror (=0 if tolerance reached, <>0 if problems)
