!    total energy              =     -15.86020317 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -15.86020317 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.6E-11 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =       4.64579668 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       1.09653865 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -4.80160884 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -16.80092965 Ry
     - averaged Fock potential =      -0.00000000 Ry
     + Fock energy             =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   9 iterations
