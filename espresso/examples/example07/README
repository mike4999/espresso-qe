This example illustrates how to calculate electron-phonon interaction
coefficients at X for fcc Al.

The calculation proceeds as follows (for the meaning of the cited input
variables see the appropriate INPUT_* file)

1) make a self-consistent calculation for Al.
   (input=al.scf.in, output=al.scf.out) 

2) make a non self-consistent calculation for X point.
   (input=al.nscf.in, output=al.nscf.out)

3) make a phonon calculation at X, saving the dynamical matrix in file
   'al.dyn' and the self-consistent first-order variation of the
   potential into file 'aldv' (variable fildvscf) written in the
   directory $TMP_DIR.  The grid of k-points used in this step should be
   large enough to get converged results for phonons (note that the grid
   used in the example is NOT large enough)

4) make a non scf calculation as required by a phonon calculation at X,
   with a larger k-point grid.
   (input=al.nscf2.in, output=al.nscf2.out)

5) make the electron-phonon calculation by specifying
   elph=.true., trans=-.false., and the input files:
   fildvscf='aldv', fildyn='al.dyn'
   The grid of k-points that is used in this step should be large enough
   to get converged results for the electron-phonon coefficients at X
   (note that the one used in the example is NOT large enough).

In principle it should be possible to use the same grid of k-points to
calculate both phonons and electron-phonon coefficients. However, this is
not convenient, because the latter are much more difficult to converge
with respect to the number of k-points than the former.
