     Program PWSCF     v.4.1a   starts ...
     Today is 10Jul2009 at 17:18:21 

     Parallel version (MPI)

     Number of processors in use:       1

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     Too few procs for parallel algorithm
       we need at least 4 procs per pool
     a serial algorithm will be used

     the Fermi energy is    14.8686 ev

!    total energy              =    -213.20013808 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =    -213.20013808 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.6E-10 Ry

     total all-electron energy =     -3309.957156 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -31.86170363 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      15.00696294 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -19.53713982 Ry
