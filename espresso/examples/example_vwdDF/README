This example shows how to use the vdw-DF functional in pw.x, a
method based on the one proposed by Guillermo Roman-Perez and 
Jose M. Soler in:

   G. Roman-Perez and J. M. Soler, PRL 103, 096102 (2009)

henceforth referred to as SOLER. That method is a new implementation
of the method found in:

   M. Dion, H. Rydberg, E. Schroeder, D. C. Langreth, and
   B. I. Lundqvist, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004).

henceforth referred to as DION. Further information about the
functional and its corresponding potential can be found in:

   T. Thonhauser, V.R. Cooper, S. Li, A. Puzder, P. Hyldgaard,
   and D.C. Langreth, Phys. Rev. B 76, 125112 (2007).

applied to so far can be found at:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The example will first check if every file is present, and then run
the simulations. As for this particular kind of implementation, the
vdw-DF need a so called "table", a universal file that has to be
generated once and used for all other calculations.

This table, stored in ACSII format, usually ships with the QE distri-
bution, in case the file is not present the example will launch the
routine needed to generate it. It can be a long process, up to 30 mins
in basic single CPU machine, but once generated can be used in any
other machine and ofr any other calculations.

After the check, and the possiible generation, the example will proceed
with two simulations, in particolar

1) A variable cell relaxation of a simple 1x1 graphite. The parameters
used (such as k-point mesh and energy cutoffs are not converged, use them
only for some proof-of-concet runs). Here the stress will be used to
converge the cell at 0 pressure.

2) A self-consistent energy calculation of a water dimer in the
equilibrium configuration.  Check the energies and forces against
those in the reference file.

bonus) If you have in the PP dir the Ar.pz-rrkj.UPF you can activate the
last exaple by removing the comments from the execution lines (277-280). In 
this example it's shown how to tun a BFGS relaxation of the forces for the 
Argon dimer. Check that the energies and forces agree with those in the 
reference file, and that the final positions are right.
