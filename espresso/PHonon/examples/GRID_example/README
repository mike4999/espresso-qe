This example shows how to use ph.x on a GRID. The GRID phonon parallelization
allows to split a phonon calculation into relatively small jobs, each
runing a subset of linear-response calculations for a small number of
wave-vectors or irreps or compbinations. The jobs can then be run
independently and the final results collected. Documentation is available

The calculation is the same as example06. In run_example all q-vectors and
all irreps are split into different runs. In run_example_1 all q-vectors are 
split into different runs.

The calculation in run_example proceeds as follows:

1) A self consistent calculation is done:
(input alas.scf.in, output alas.scf.out)

2) A preparatory phonon run with start_irr=0, last_irr=0 calculates the
displacement patterns:
(input alas.ph.in0, output alas.ph.out0)

3) ph.x is run for each representation of each q point. 
The code runs with different outdir and only the xml files are copied 
in the same outdir
(input input.#q.#irr, output output.#q.#irr)

4) A final phonon calculation collects all the dynamical matrices
 (input alas.ph.in, output alas.ph.out)

5) q2r and matdyn compute the interatomic force constants and the dispersions.

The calculation in run_example_1 proceeds as follows:

1) A self consistent calculation is done:
(input alas.scf.in, output alas.scf.out)

2) ph.x is run for each q point. 
The code runs with different outdir. This step can be done in different
machines or different processors. 
(input input.#q, output output.#q)

3) q2r and matdyn compute the interatomic force constants and the dispersions.

The calculation in run_example_3 is a variation of run_example
in which all the bands are calculated first and then the band files are
copied in the outdir directories or each ph.x run.
At variance with run_example it does not recalculate the
initialization (bands and electric field) for each irreducible 
representation, but it occupies more disk space. Each different q must be 
run in a different directory using lqdir=.true. It might be more convenient 
than run_example for systems with many atoms and few q points.

The run is as follows:

1) A self consistent calculation is done:
(input alas.scf.in, output alas.scf.out)

2) A preparatory phonon run with lqdir=.true. and only_init=.true. calculates 
the displacement patterns, the bands and if necessary the dielectric
constant and effective charges
(input alas.ph.in0, output alas.ph.out0)

3-5) The rest is as in run_example (Note however that lqdir=.true. must
be used in all phonon inputs).
