This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the total energy
and the band structure of fcc-Pt with a fully relativistic US-PP
which includes spin-orbit effects.
It tests ph.x for the calculation of the phonons in the spin-orbit case.

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1) make a self-consistent calculation for Pt (input=pt.scf.in,
   output=pt.scf.out). 

2) make a band structure calculation for Pt (input=pt.nscf.in,
   output=pt.nscf.out).

3) use the bands.x program to check the band symmetry (input=pt.bands.in,
   output=pt.bands.out).

4) make a self-consistent calculation for fcc-Pt with few k-points
   (input=pt.scf_ph.in, output=pt.scf_ph.out).

5) make a phonon calculation at the Gamma point (input=pt.ph.in,
   output=pt.ph.out).

6) make a phonon calculation at X (input=pt.phX.in, output=pt.phX.out).
