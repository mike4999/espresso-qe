     Program PWSCF     v.4.1a   starts ...
     Today is 14Jul2009 at 20:35:28 

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field
