     Today is 20Feb2009 at  9:22:21 

     Parallel version (MPI)

     Number of processors in use:       1

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     gamma-point specific algorithms are used


     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     Too few procs for parallel algorithm
       we need at least 4 procs per pool
     a serial algorithm will be used
