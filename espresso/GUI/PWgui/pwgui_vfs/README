This directory is used for building a pwgui starkit---a
self-contained, installation-free StandAlone Runtime TclKIT.

The starkit will be build in ./pwgui.vfs subdirectory.

IMPORTANT: If the pwgui_vfs tarball has been created by "make
pwgui-starkit-vfs" from the PWgui source directory, then you need to
use the "make from_tarball" within this directory.
