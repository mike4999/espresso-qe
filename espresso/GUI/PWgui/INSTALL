            * * * INSTALLATION instructions for PWgui * * *
 ==============================================================================

Because PWgui is written in [incr Tcl]---an extension of Tcl
scripting language----no compilation is needed.

*** HOWEVER *** the package depends on the [incr Tcl] and related
software. Therefore you have two possibility: 

   (i)  to use a standalone executable which run out of the box (works
	only on the platform for which it have been built)

   (ii) to use source package if required Tcl software is installed
        (see SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section below)

(I) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STANDALONE EXECUTABLE

The standalone executable run out of the box. It is a self-contained,
and installation-free. Simply download and unzip (or untar). For
zipped pwgui-xxx.zip package do:
	
	* unzip pwgui-xxx.zip, 

while for tarred pwgui-xxx.tgz package do either:

	* tar zxvf pwgui-xxx.tgz 
or: 
	* gunzip -c pwgui-xxx.tgz | tar xvf -

That' all!!! To launch the program type: pwgui.

Here is a list of platforms on which standalone pwgui executables are
available:

+ Linux-i386
+ Macintosh (for Mac OS X, PWgui requires X11)
+ Windows

(II) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE

To use the source package you need required Tcl software (see SOFTWARE
REQUIREMENTS section below). If you are using PWgui's CVS sources see
also the INSTALL.cvs file.

VERY SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------

 1. untar the PWgui archive,
 2. define the PWGUI environmental variable,
 3. add $PWGUI to your path, and
 4. to launch the PWgui program, type: pwgui	


A BIT LONGER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------------------

To install the PWgui package do the following:

   1.) untar the *.tgz archive. use one of the following:

	gunzip -c pwgui.tgz | tar xvf -
     or
	gunzip pwgui.tgz; tar xvf pwgui.tar
     or 
        tar zxvf pwgui.tgz (for GNU tar program only)

   2.) define the PWGUI environmental variable to point to the package
       root directory

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PWGUI=/pwgui/root/dir; export PWGUI
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    setenv PWGUI /pwgui/root/dir

   3.) add the PWGUI environmental variable to your path. Depending
       on your shell edit one of ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.cshrc,
       or alike:

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PATH="$PWGUI:$PATH"
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    set path = ( $PWGUI $path )

   4.) to launch the PWgui program type: pwgui


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE
----------------------------------------

The PWgui source package depends on the following Tcl-related
software:

	Tcl + Tk   >= 8.3
	Itcl + Itk >= 3.1
	Iwidgets   >= 3.0

The Itcl, Itk, and Iwidgets stand for: [incr Tcl], [incr Tk], and
[incr Widgets]. All these packages are usually already present on
modern Linux distributions, otherwise their RPMs (DEBs) can be easily
found on the WEB. 

For Tcl/Tk see:             http://www.scriptics.com/
For ITcl/Itk/Iwidgets see:  http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/

Alternatively you may install ActiveTcl which includes all the
Tcl/Tk/Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets. See:  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Tcl


Troubleshooting
***************

Problem: Segmentation fault
Solution: for some Linux distributions the "itkwish" package is
sometimes broken, while for other the "pwgui" used to crash if it was
called with "wish" package. If you experience such kind of troubles
then replace in file pwgui the call to "wish" ("itkwish") with
"itkwish" ("wish"). If that doesn't help, then install and use
ActiveTcl (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Tcl) which--as far as my
experience goes--always works.
