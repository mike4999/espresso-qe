A Raman/nonlinear susceptibility calculation requires the following steps:

  - a simple scf calculation with pw.x

  - a calculation with ph.x for both electric-field response
    and phonon modes: trans=.epsil., epsil=.true.
    The output delta rho must be saved to a file, by specifying
    let us say fildrho='delta.rho'. Two files, 'delta.rho.E' and
    'delta.rho.U' will actually be written in the scratch directory

  - a non-scf calculation with option calculation='raman' and with
    appropriate values of b_length, lcart set in namelist &raman,
    that follows all other namelists (see below for their meaning)

  - finally, a calculation with ram.x
    Variables fildrho, b_length, lcart should be the same as in
    the preceding steps.  Variables outdir and prefix must be 
    the same in all steps.

The input data for ram.x is the same as for a phonon calculation,
followed by a namelist "&inputram".

  See file INPUT_PH for the first part of the input.
  Note that fildrho, in namelist &inputph, must be the same as
  specified in the ph.x calculation (in the example above, 'delta.rho'),
  and xq must be set to 0.

           ========

  b_length :    length of the b vector to be used for evaluating finite
                differences. MUST BE SPECIFIED and must be the same as
                specified in the calculation='raman' step of pw.x

  lcart :       logical, define whether the finite differences are
                taken along cartesian axis (.true.) or in directions
                of the next neighboring k points. Must be the same as
                pecified in the  calculation='raman' step of pw.x
                Default: .true.
 
  lsus :        logical, defines whether the nonlinear susceptibility 
                is calculated.
                Default: .false.
 
  lram :        logical, defines whether the Raman tensor is calculated.
                default: .false.
 
  lboth :       logical, if .true. the finite differences are calculated
                by taking the values at k+b and k-b
                default: .true.
 
  lelfield :    logical, if .true. the finite differences are calculated
                by taking the values of the perturbed wavefunctions of
                the electric field at the points k+b, while the perturbed
                wavefunctions with the atomic displacement is just
                taken at the points k.
                Default: .false.
     
  latomic :     logical, like lelfield just with the finer mesh for the 
                atomic displacement and the original grid for the electric 
                field.
                default: .false.
 
  filsus :      File for the nonlinear susceptibility
                Default: 'nonl_suscept'
              
  filram :      File for the Raman tensor
                Default: 'raman_tens'
