c epsil       if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the      .false.
c             macroscopic dielectric constant of the system is 
c             computed. Do not set epsil to .true. if you have a
c             metallic system or q/=0: the code will complain and stop
c
c trans       if .true. the phonons are computed                      .true.
c             If trans.and.epsil effective charges are calculated            
c
c lraman      if .true. calculate nonresonant Raman coefficients      .false.

c             For metals only, requires gaussian smearing.
c             If elph.and.trans, the lambdas are calculated in the same
c             run, using the same k-point grid for phonons and lambdas
c             If elph.and..not.trans, the lambdas are calculated using
c             previously saved DeltaVscf in fildvscf, previously saved
c             dynamical matrix, and the present punch file. This allows
c             the use of a different (larger) k-point grid.
c
c zue         if .true. in a q=0 calculation for a non metal the 
c             effective charges are computed from the phonon
c             density responses. Note that if trans.and.epsil
c             effective charges are calculated using a different
c             algorithm. The results should be the same within
c             numerical noise.
