14 Sep 2004 Allocation of evc when starting from atomic wavefunctions 
            modified so that evc contain only the real number bands and 
            not all the atomic wfcs (they can be much more than the
            number of bands). 
            unified setup.f90 for both collinear and noncollinear case.
            (CS)

13 Sep 2004 Merge of cell dynamics (CC): 
            - same cell dynamics subroutines used in CP and FPMD
            - input pressure in GPa ( both code )
            - Output stress in GPa ( both code )
            - Output layout made more similar:
              energies, positions, forces, cell displayed in the same way
            - Zero velocities after a restart implemented in CP
            - Nose and damped dynamics for cell implemented
              in FPMD like in CP
            - CP main subroutine simplified
            Various GUI changes (TK)
            Minor output format change, examples updated (PG)
            DIIS: small bug-fix and general clean-up of the code.
            ionode substituted by meta_ionode (this because in neb and 
            smd all images have an ionode, but only one image, the one
            identified by meta_ionode, can check stop). (CS)

 8 Sep 2004 configure.old, documentation for configure updated [Gerardo]
            moved install/README.install to README.install_old [Gerardo]

            Fixed some severe bugs. (CS)
            Changed name par2.x to fpmd.x in examples (PG)
            configure: don't try f77 as f90, won't work anyway [Gerardo]

            non-tetragonal cell. (Contributed by N. Bonini).

 1 Sep 2004 The error message is no longer written on /dev/stderr 
            (on linux clusters), but only on unit *. (C.S.)
            missing ZSYRK and ZSYR2K subroutines added to the 
            local copy of blas (PC)
            Small configure fix for Mac; examples, minor fix (GB)

            file. (CS)

27 Aug 2004  Misc Alpha fixes (CS)
             Z* are  written on output in a consistent way (Gernot)
             More merging between CP and FPMD:
             - initialization (both code uses the same ggen)
             - now FPMD initializes the small-boxes too (required for USPP)
             - print out
             (CC)

             Changes to use of "fildrho" in phonon, d3, Raman calculationi
             calculation of nonlinear susceptibility fixed, example 15
             updated (Gernot)

25 Aug 2004  Fixed some errors in constrained dynamics. "Fixed atoms" and
             explicit constraints are now compatible when they do not involve
             the same atoms. Fixed a bug in the definition of the tangent
             in the Fourier string method dynamics. (CS)
             Makefiles, examples 8-11 updated. Old Raman code renamed 
             "phcg.f90" in order to avoid confusion with new cod3 (PG)

             parallelization on images was not properly working
             cleanup in the way ATOMIC_POSITIONS card is readi.
             Minor fixes to compute_scf.f90 (C.S.)
             Minor Mac OS-X fix .

20 Aug 2004  Manuals for PW and CP/FPMD merged  [Gerardo]
             bugfix for configure on AIX [Gerardo]

             Example for electric-field gradient calculation (MP)

             $HOME/O-sesame to $HOME/espresso [Gerardo]
             efg.f90: typos corrected in the printout of various tensors

             unused case calculation='dispersion' removed (PG)
             Various missing README added, minor manual changes [Gerardo]

18 Aug 2004  NEB code reorganization. All the routines involved in "path" 
             optimization are grouped into modules starting with "path_". 
             The output has been slightly restyled. 
             In the pwscf code (only) has been implemented a version of the 
             string method (calculation='smd') in which the path is represented 
             in Fourier components and the optimization procedure is done on 
             these components (still to be optimized, but working).
             BFGS: Interpolation of the "accepted" bfgs step disabled 
             (not yet safe). (CS)

17 Aug 2004  Initialization of startingpot in the "raman" case fixed 
             Documentation update (PG)

16 Aug 2004  The fix for the problem "PBE on hydrogen atom" (see commit 
             10-05-2004) has been moved from gradcorr.f90 to 
             lsda_functionals.f90 so that both pwscf and the atomic code
             share the same fix (CS)

13 Aug 2004  Documentation for Raman updated (PG)

11 Aug 2004  Manual update and cleanup (GB, PG). 
             Added RANLIB=echo to old Make.* (PG)

 9 Aug 2004  Support for mac-osx added (contributed by Pascal Thibaudeau)
             Extensive documentation update and reshuffling : pwdocs
             and cpdocs merged into Doc (PG)

 9-Aug-2004  NEB restart file modified again: with the current implementation 
             of quick-min pos_old and grad_old need not to be saved in the
             restart file. Logical variables for reset_vel and frozen images
             have been moved from "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" to 
             "QUICK-MIN FIELDS". Old restart files can be easily converted
             removing in the "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" field all 
             logical variables and removing all the "QUICK-MIN FIELDS".
             (CS)

 1 Aug 2004  same variable accessed from 2 different modules, some
             compilers complain, fixed (CC)
