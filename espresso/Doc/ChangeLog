 9 Aug 2004  Support for mac-osx added (contributed by Pascal Thibaudeau)
             Extensive documentation update and reshuffling : pwdocs
             and cpdocs merged into Doc (PG)

 9-Aug-2004  NEB restart file modified again: with the current implementation 
             of quick-min pos_old and grad_old need not to be saved in the
             restart file. Logical variables for reset_vel and frozen images
             have been moved from "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" to 
             "QUICK-MIN FIELDS". Old restart files can be easily converted
             removing in the "ENERGIES, POSITIONS AND GRADIENTS" field all 
             logical variables and removing all the "QUICK-MIN FIELDS".
             (C.S.)

 1 Aug 2004  same variable accessed from 2 different modules, some
             compilers complain, fixed (CC)
