Program CPVIB

Calculates the vibrational modes, Born effective charges and infrared 
cross-section for isolated molecules/clusters in vacuum. 
The programs uses the CP code as the underlying DFT engine 
for wave function relaxation (SCF) and the frozen phonon method for 
construction of the energy hessian (dynamical matrix), 
i.e. displace each atom in all three cartesian directions to construct 
the numerical first derivative of the forces.

The program uses two mandatory input files (optional files are discussed
further below):
1. The regular CP input file, which presumably was used to generate a 
   ground state nuclear configuration (local minimum).
2. A file "prefix.vib.inp", where prefix is defined in the CP input
   file.

 prefix.vib.inp  contains one name list:

 &INPUT_VIB
 ...
 /

Parameters:

delta		real ( default = 0.05 )
		displacement step, a uniform value for all atoms

save_freq	integer ( default = 1 )
		Save restart information every save_freq displacements.
		Since it is usually a small file, containing mainly
		the intermediate hessian, it is suggested not to
		change the default.

restart_label	character ( default = 'auto' )
		'from_scratch': starts a new calculation
		'restart'     : continue a previous calculation
		                a file 'prefix.vib.restart' must be present
		'auto'        : if a file 'prefix.vib.restart' is present
		                the program will pick it up and continue
				the previous calculation, or if absent,
				it will start a new calculation

trans_inv_flag	logical ( default = .true. )
		impose translational invariance on the energy hessian
		to ensure that the modes associated with a rigid
		translation would have zero frequency

trans_inv_max_iter	integer ( default = 50 )
		the maximal number of steps in the iterative procedure
		that removes the rigid translation modes

trans_inv_conv_thr	real ( default = 1.0D-15 )
		the threshhold for convergence of the iterative procedure
		for removal of the rigid translation modes

trans_rot_inv_flag	logical ( default = .true. )
		remove also the rigid rotation modes

animate		logical ( default = .false. )
		generate xyz animation files for all normal modes


Additional information about the input/output files:

1. The program will look for the presence of 'prefix.vib.isotope' file.
   It is a text file containing NAT lines, where NAT is the number of atoms.
   Each line contains a single number, the mass of this particular atom
   in the same order as in the CP input file. The masses are in AMU, i.e. 
   the hydrogen is ~1, carbon is 12 etc. If this file is present, these masses
   are used in the calculation. If not, the default masses are used, 
   as specified in the CP input, and an isotopes file is created. 
   This is useful for testing the isotope shifts, without having to 
   redo the full calculation.

2. After the energy hessian is calculated, the program will write
   the analysis results to 'prefix.vib.analysis'.
   The minimal output is: 
	* raw (but symmetrized) hessian 
	* diagonal mass matrix
	* harmonic frequencies and the associated effective 
	  spring constant and effective mode mass
	* raw Born charge tensors for each atom
	* the sum over the Born charges (minus total system charge)
	  this quantity should ideally be zero (acoustic sum rule).
	* infrared intensity of each normal mode.

   If trans_inv_flag==.true. then the same information as above is repeated
   but this time with imposed translational invariance on the energy
   hessian. In addition,  the Born charges are symmetrized and
   the acoustic sum rule is imposed.

   if trans_rot_inv_flag==.true. then also rotational modes are projected
   out. 


A brief description of the methods:

1. The energy hessian is constructed by a simple difference formula for
   the numerical first derivative of the forces.

2. The condition for translational invariance of the hessian is described
   (for instance) in Gonze and Lee, Phys. Rev. B 55(16), 1997, 10355-10368.
   However, simple enforcement of translational invariance breaks the 
   symmetry of the hessian. Here symmetrization and translational 
   invariance are repeatedly applied until convergence, i.e., until
   the largest change in any matrix element of the hessian is smaller
   than trans_inv_conv_thr parameter.
   A more sophisticated and general algorithm was suggested by
   Nicolas Mounet and Nicola Marzari (Ref. ???) and is already implemented 
   in QE.

3. The algorithm for removal of rotational rigid modes follows closely the 
   one implemented in Gaussian03 electronic structure package, as described 
   in their white papers (www.gaussian.com).
