!  
!   This program computes the transmittance of a system and/or its
!   complex band structure. 
!   It is controlled through the following variables 
!   in the namelist inputcond:
!
! outdir      temporary directory (as in PWscf)
! prefix      prefix for file names (as in PWscf)
! fil_loc     file on/from which the 2D eigenvalue problem data
!             are saved/read 
! lwrite_loc  if .t. save 2D eigenvalue problem result in fil_loc
! lread_loc   if .t. read 2D eigenvalue problem result from fil_loc
! ikind       the kind of conductance calculation:
!             ikind=0  - just complex band structure (CBS) calculation
!             ikind=1  - conductance calculation with identical 
!                        left and right tips
!             ikind=2  - conductance calculation with different
!                        left and right tips       
! iofspin     spin index for which the calculations are performed
! llocal      if .t. calculations are done with only local part of PP 
! bdl1        left boundary of the left tip 
! bdl2        right boundary of the left tip 
! bdr1        left boundary of the right tip 
! bdr2        right boundary  of the right tip
! nz1         the number of subslabs in the slab (to calculate integrals)
! dnslab      additional number of slabs
! estart      initial energy 
! denergy     energy step (if denergy=0.0 the energy is read from the list)
! nenergy     number of energies 
!             WARNING: the energy in input file is given in eV taken from Ef,
!                      and denergy should be negative
! ecut2d      2-D cutoff
! ewind       the energy window for reduction of 2D plane wave basis set (in XY)
! epsproj     accuracy of 2D basis set reduction
! llapack     if .t. use the LAPACK routine for Generalized Eigenvalue 
!             Problem (GEP)
!
!
!  Cards after the namelist:
!
!   Number of k_\perp points
!   kx, ky, weight
!   number of energy points
