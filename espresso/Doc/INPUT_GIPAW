                     GIPAW input file description 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
This is the description of the input file format for the gipaw.x code.

The input consists of a single NAMELIST called "inputgipaw", containing
the following variables:

job     CHARACTER (default = 'nmr')
        select calculation to perform. The possible values are:
        'f-sum'        check the f-sum rule
        'nmr'          compute the magnetic suscept. and NMR chemical shifts
        'g_tensor'     compute the EPR g-tensor
        'efg'          compute the electric field gradients at the nuclei

prefix   CHARACTER (default = 'prefix')
         prefix of files saved by program pw.x

tmp_dir  CHARACTER (default = './scratch/')
         temporary directory where pw.x files resides

conv_threshold  REAL (default = 1.d-14)
         convergence threshold for the diagonalization and for the Green's
         function solver

isolve   INTEGER (default = 0)
         diagonalization method (0 = Davidson, 1 = CG)

q_gipaw  REAL (default = 0.01)
         small vector for long wavelength linear response

iverbosity  INTEGER (default = 0) 
          if iverbosity > 0 print more information in output

filcurr  CHARACTER (default = '')
         for saving the induced current (valence only)

filfield CHARACTER (default = '')
         for saving the induced magnetic field (valence only)

read_recon_in_paratec_fmt  LOGICAL (default = .FALSE.)
         for reading reconstruction data from Paratec converted
         pseudopotentials

file_reconstruction(:) CHARACTER
         for each pseudopotential, the file name with reconstruction data

use_nmr_macroscopic_shape  LOGICAL
         correct the chemical shift by taking into account the macroscopic
         shape of the sample

nmr_macroscopic_shape(3,3)  REAL (default = 2/3)
         tensor for the macroscopic shape correction

spline_ps  LOGICAL (default = .TRUE.)
         interpolate pseudopotentials with cubic splines (better accuracy
         of the chemical shifts)
