! Main program for conductance calculation. 
! This program generalizes to US-PP the method of Choi and Ihm
! ( PRB 59, 2267 (1999) ).
! The ballistic conductance G is calculated via the
! Landauer formula ( G=e^2/h T ), where the total
! transmission T is obtained by solving the scattering 
! problem.

 ! actually does not work, since stop_pp already stops program (fix?)
